## 0.7.0

### Minor Changes

- ### `@segnavia/format`

  - Add the validated `BookView` interchange shape and JSON Schema.

  ### `@segnavia/html`

  - Keeps the HTML package aligned with the shared 0.7.0 package release; it has no package-specific API changes.

  ### `@segnavia/frame`

  - Add the continuous-book frame element for host-built book views.
  - Handles links to in-page targets inside a library frame without navigating the frame away. Links to missing targets leave the frame in place.

  ### `@segnavia/react`

  - First release published to npm: typed React components for the player and controls, with `useDeckController` and `useAuthoring`

  ### `@segnavia/render`

  - Keep overflowing multi-page, growing, fluid and book prints at true size and report their clipped content.

  ### `@segnavia/capture`

  - Keeps the capture package aligned with the shared 0.7.0 package release; it has no package-specific API changes.

  ### `@segnavia/voice`

  - Keeps the voice package aligned with the shared 0.7.0 package release; it has no package-specific API changes.

## 0.6.0

### Patch Changes

- Updated dependencies
  - @segnavia/frame@0.6.0

## 0.5.0

### Minor Changes

- ### `@segnavia/format`

  - Adds `deckFromSlides(slides, options)`, which turns generic slide rows (HTML or shot, with optional notes, narration and timing) into a validated `Deck`. `omitNotes` drops notes for public use.
  - Adds contents placement, depth, endnotes titles, and recto-opening control to the book format.

  ### `@segnavia/html`

  - Transforms books into ordered HTML sections with generated contents and notes.

  ### `@segnavia/frame`

  - Adds `<segnavia-rail>`, a lazy thumbnail strip, and the player's `rail` attribute. The rail sits at the inline start of the slide (left in left-to-right decks, right in right-to-left ones) and moves below the bar on narrow screens.
  - Adds the opt-in authoring entry `@segnavia/frame/authoring`. `attachAuthoring(player, handlers, options?)` offers reorder (`moveSlide`) and notes (`saveNotes`) only for the handlers a host passes. The library holds the optimistic state, rollback, autosave, and dirty and error events; the host owns every write.
  - While notes have focus, slide scripts are paused so a slide cannot take the editor's keystrokes.
  - Exports the canonical element-name maps.
  - Behavior change: a player in normal page flow now sizes its slide from its width, like a video. A host that gives the player a definite height and wants the slide fitted to it sets `fit="height"`.

  ### `@segnavia/react`

  - New package: typed React components for the player, stage and every control, with `useDeckController` and `useAuthoring`. React and React DOM are peer dependencies of this package only.
  - The package is not yet published to npm.

  ### `@segnavia/render`

  - Prints near-neutral colors with black ink alone within a configurable press tolerance.

### Patch Changes

- Updated dependencies
  - @segnavia/frame@0.5.0
