A printed Document may hold one or more flowing `section` children instead of a single `page`. Each section has exactly one `flow` child and may set `title`, `opens` and `numbering`. A printed section refuses `parents`, `contents`, `contentsLabel`, `subtitle`, `headTemplate` and `pageGeometry`, and a first section that opens with `continue` is refused. Folios come from the section plan, so an uncounted cover carries no number, while printed-page rules choose only each page's parent, face, side and role. `printedPage.total`, in books and printed documents, is now the folio of the last counted body page (falling back to the last counted page), so an uncounted cover no longer adds to "page i of m". `<segnavia-page>`, `pagePdf` and `pagesPdf` compose sectioned printed documents, and `@segnavia/html` exports `resolvePrintedPageHtml`, `isPrintedHtmlPage`, `printedPageAuthorHtml`, `printedPageDirection`, `printedSectionFlows` and the `PrintedHtmlPage` type for them. Imposition (`<segnavia-paper>` and the printable-pages document) refuses a sectioned printed document. A single-page printed document composes exactly as before.
